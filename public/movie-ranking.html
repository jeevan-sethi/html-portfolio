<h1> The Best Movies According to Jeevan </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3> Harry Potter Series </h3>
<p> I would rank the Harry Potter series at the top because I grew up watching Harry Potter from the very first movie and I've also read all the books. I love the friendship, love, resilience, strength shown in the movie, and how magical it all is. </p>

<h3> 12th Fail </h3>
<p> 12th Fail is an inspiring movie of a young Indian boy who comes from a remote village in India, and is faced with stuggles and hardships on his journey to becoming an IAS Officer. </p>

<h3> Eat Pray Love </h3>
<p> This movie has always been my go-to movie whenever I find myself lost, or wanting to seek the thrill of adventure. This movie is a great choice to watch, grab your popcorn and get cozy! </p>
