<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Jeevan Sethi and I currently live in Calgary, Alberta. I have a huge passion for learning and I feel like I always had a unique interest on learning about building things, solving puzzles, and putting pieces together. I did a course in Digital Health and wellness, where we had a project to create a website and that's where a spark of interest began in web development.
Ever since then, I was curious to learn more about building websites and making it come to life with my personal ideas and creativity. Play around in my portfolio as you're just one click away on viewing my projects!</p>
